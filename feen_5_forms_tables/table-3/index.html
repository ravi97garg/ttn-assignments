			  <p><strong>Kathy Lasker and Lisa Peterson </strong>
			  finished second and third, respectively. 
			  Laura's victory came on the heels of her performance at the NCAA Track and 
			  Field Championships, in which she placed second running for Colorado State.</p>
        
        
			  <p>In an exciting race, <strong>Peter Teagan</strong> of San Antonio, Texas, used a finishing 
			  kick to win the men's marathon for the second straight year, in a time of 2 hr. 
			  12 min. 34 sec. Ahead for much of the race, <strong>Kyle Wills</strong> of Billings, Montana, 
			  finished second when he could not match Teagan's finishing pace. <strong>Jason Wu</strong> of 
			  Cutler, Colorado, placed third in a very competitive field.</p>
			  <p>This year's race through downtown Boulder boasted the largest field in the 
			  marathon's history, with over 9500 men and 6700 women competing. Race conditions 
			  were perfect with low humidity and temperatures that never exceeded 85 degrees.</p>
